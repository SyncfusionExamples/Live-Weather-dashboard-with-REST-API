# Live Weather dashboard with REST API

In today's data-driven world, visualizing real-time data is crucial for making informed decisions. Weather data represents one of the most dynamic and globally relevant datasets, making it perfect for demonstrating advanced dashboard capabilities. A Live Weather Dashboard not only provides visual clarity on atmospheric conditions but also makes complex meteorological trends accessible through interactive UI components.

This document guide will walk you through creating a sophisticated Live Weather Dashboard using [Syncfusion MAUI Chart controls](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts), demonstrating professional REST API integration, responsive progress bar visualizations, and cross-platform compatibility. Our dashboard will feature real-time weather metrics, interactive charts with custom tooltips, and seamless client-server architecture that delivers up-to-the-minute forecasts for any location worldwide.


## Understanding REST APIs in Weather Dashboard Context 
`REST API` (Representational State Transfer) serves as the foundational architecture for modern client-server communication, particularly crucial for data-driven applications like our Live Weather Dashboard. In the context of weather applications, REST APIs act as the critical bridge between your MAUI client application and external weather data providers, enabling real-time atmospheric data retrieval through standardized HTTP protocols.

### Key Benefits of REST API Integration:
* Stateless: Each request is independent and self-contained.
* Standard Methods: Uses HTTP GET for easy data retrieval.
* JSON Format: Lightweight and easy to bind to UI.
* Scalable: Handles multiple requests efficiently.
* Real-Time: Always fetches the latest data.

## Implementing REST API Client Architecture
The REST API client architecture forms the backbone of our Live Weather Dashboard, enabling seamless communication between the client application and external weather services. Our implementation follows enterprise-grade patterns for reliability, performance, and maintainability

### REST API Client Implementation
We use the [Open-Meteo REST API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to fetch weather data. The `FetchWeatherData` method implements robust `HTTP client` architecture with comprehensive error handling and efficient JSON deserialization. This method serves as the primary interface between our application and the Open-Meteo weather service.

### API Endpoint Construction:
`FetchWeatherData` method constructs a sophisticated REST API endpoint with multiple query parameters:

* Latitude/Longitude: Precise geographic coordinates from the selected country
* Daily Metrics: temperature_2m_mean, precipitation_probability_mean, wind_speed_10m_mean
* Hourly Data: temperature_2m for detailed forecast visualization
* Timezone Handling: auto ensures localized time representation
* Forecast Duration: forecast_days=7 provides a full week of weather data

### HTTP Client Management and JSON Deserialization:
Efficient HTTP client management and robust JSON deserialization are building reliable and scalable REST API integrations. In our Live Weather Dashboard, we use the HttpClient class to perform a GET request to the Open-Meteo API, retrieving structured weather data in JSON format.

## Building Interactive Charts with Syncfusion
To visualize weather trends clearly and interactively, the dashboard uses [Syncfusion MAUI Toolkit SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/cartesian-charts/getting-started), a powerful charting control that supports animation, tooltips, and theme-aware customization.

## Weather Metrics with Circular Progress Bars
The Syncfusion [SfCircularProgressBar](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui-toolkit/circularprogressbar/getting-started) control provides an elegant way to display current weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation in a circular format, with animated, theme-aware progress indicators that effectively communicate data intensity and context.
